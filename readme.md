# Quote Generator
Image generator that takes user input for text, images, and alignment to create customized quote photos, which can be saved and shared.
# Skills Involved / Stuff I Learned
- HTML / CSS Significant use to create the layout for the page and basic functionality.
- Javascript for backend functionality.

- First real time doing webdev, learned how to properly connect HTML, CSS and Javascript. Used vanilla javascript for the backend, but React might be good next time for doing such a front-end focused project. Very helpful for learning webdev.
